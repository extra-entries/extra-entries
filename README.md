[Entries] is a list of key-value pairs, with unique keys. [:running:] [:vhs:] [:package:] [:moon:] [:ledger:]

Methods as separate packages:
- `@extra-entries/find`: use [rollup] to bundle this es module.
- `@extra-entries/find.min`: use in browser ([browserify], [uglify-js]).

After Mount St. Helens erupted, researchers had a blank slate from which to
explore the science of ecological recovery. Scientist Charley Crisafulli was
drawn to log-covered Spirit Lake, where nutrient rich waters fueled an
unusually fast resurgence in fish, plant life and amphibians. Itâ€™s a
phenomenon that continues to fascinate scientists everywhere. Originally
broadcast in 2008. [(1)]

const entries = require('extra-entries');
// import * as entries from 'extra-entries';
